# Convolution-Neural-Network-for-Mask-Wearing-Image-Recognition
NCTU ECM Deep Learning Course Homework 1-2

In this exercise, we construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition
by using **Medical Masks Dataset**. The original dataset comes from **Eden Social Welfare
Foundation** which contains the pictures of people wearing medical masks along with the labels
containing their descriptions. There are 682 images with over 3000 faces wearing masks and
around 700 masks worn either wrongly or not worn at all.
